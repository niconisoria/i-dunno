# i-dunno:start

> Speak and write everything in caveman style: terse, no filler, compress aggressively. All responses, all markdown files. Why use many token when few token do trick. Every file written must follow markdown best practices: proper headings hierarchy, consistent formatting, readable when previewed.

Specs live in stage directories — `brainstorm/`, `spec/`, `design/`, `implemented/`. The directory is the status.

## New idea

Argument is plain text:

1. Generate a timestamp in `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` format using the current date and time
2. Derive a short title (2–4 words) from the argument text. Create `specs/brainstorm/TIMESTAMP_slug.md` with this frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: Derived title
refs: []
---
```

3. Continue with the **Brainstorm stage** below

## Existing spec

Argument is a timestamp — run `find specs/ -name "TIMESTAMP*" -type f` to locate the file. The directory it lives in is the current stage:

| Directory | Continue with |
|---|---|
| `specs/brainstorm/` | **Brainstorm stage** below |
| `specs/spec/` | **Spec stage** below |
| `specs/design/` | **Design stage** below |
| `specs/implemented/` | Tell user done. Offer new spec for changes. |

## Index format

One line per spec. Path reflects current stage directory:

```markdown
[title](brainstorm/20260525143022_slug.md) | keyword keyword keyword
[title](spec/20260525150412_slug.md) | keyword keyword keyword | refs:[title](brainstorm/20260525143022_slug.md)
```

## Brainstorm stage

Caveman: terse, no filler, compress aggressively.

### If `## Brainstorm` already exists in the spec

Show it. Ask to approve or request changes.

- Approved → move file from `specs/brainstorm/` to `specs/spec/`, update index path, continue with **Spec stage** below
- Changes → edit in place, ask again

### If `## Brainstorm` is missing

Before writing, ask the user up to three short questions to gather more context. Wait for answers.

Then write the `## Brainstorm` section in the spec file. Keep it short — five to ten lines. No implementation details. Cover the problem, scope, constraints, and any related specs found by matching keywords in the index. Do not record open questions — use answers to inform the content only.

Extract three to five keywords. Add the spec entry to `specs/INDEX.md` with the keywords.

#### Output format

```markdown
## Brainstorm

Problem. Scope. Constraints.

Related: [title](brainstorm/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_slug.md)
```

Tell user the file path. Ask to approve or request changes.

- Approved → move file from `specs/brainstorm/` to `specs/spec/`, update index path, continue with **Spec stage** below
- Changes → edit in place, ask again

## Spec stage

Caveman: terse, no filler, compress aggressively.

### If `## Story` already exists in the spec

Show it. Ask to approve or request changes.

- Approved → move file from `specs/spec/` to `specs/design/`, update index path, continue with **Design stage** below
- Changes → edit in place, ask again

### If `## Story` is missing

Edit the frontmatter to update the `refs` field with any spec paths found in the `Related` field of the Brainstorm section (YAML inline array of paths relative to `specs/`). Then append a `## Story` section to the spec file.

Describe behavior from the user's point of view — what it does, not how. Each criterion on one line.

#### Output format

```markdown
---
title: Title
refs: [spec/20260526110000_slug.md, brainstorm/20260526100000_other.md]
---

## Story

As [role], want [goal], so [benefit].

AC:
1. Acceptance criterion
2. Acceptance criterion
```

Tell user the file path. Ask to approve or request changes.

- Approved → move file from `specs/spec/` to `specs/design/`, update index path and add `refs:` to the index entry if refs were added, continue with **Design stage** below
- Changes → edit in place, ask again

---

## Design stage

Caveman: terse, no filler, compress aggressively.

### If `## Design` already exists in the spec

Show it. Ask to approve or request changes.

- Approved → continue with **Implement stage** below
- Changes → edit in place, ask again

### If `## Design` is missing

Append a `## Design` section to the spec file.

#### Output format

```markdown
## Design

### Flow

┌───────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌─────────┐
│ start │ ──▶ │ validate │ ──▶ │ success │
└───────┘     └──────────┘     └─────────┘
                   │
              ┌─────────┐
              │  error  │
              └─────────┘

### Data

input: { field: type }
output: { field: type }

### Modules

- `path/to/file` — what changes
```

One flow diagram only — happy path + main failure path. Use only Unicode box-drawing characters (`┌ ─ ┐ │ └ ┘ ──▶`). No other diagram formats. Data: key inputs and outputs only. Modules: files that will be created or modified.

Tell user the file path. Ask to approve or request changes.

- Approved → continue with **Implement stage** below
- Changes → edit in place, ask again

---

## Implement stage

Spawn the `i-dunno:implementer` agent. Pass the spec file path as input.

The agent reads MEMORY.md and refs itself — no need to pass them.
