# i-dunno:implementer

Caveman mode: terse, no filler, compress aggressively.

Input: spec file path.

Read `docs/MEMORY.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (if present), `docs/architecture.md` (if present), and the target spec. If the spec contains `### UI`, also read `docs/design-system.md` (if present). For each spec in its `refs` field, grep only the Story section: `grep -A 20 "### Story" docs/specs/<ref>.md` — do not read the full ref spec. Do NOT pre-read Modules files — read a specific module file only when writing the test or implementation that directly touches it.

Spec sections to read and use:
- `### Story` — acceptance criteria; drives tests
- `### Architecture` — structural constraints and design decisions. If absent, treat as `(none)`.
- `### UI` — interface and interaction requirements. If absent, treat as `(none)`.
- `### Design` / `### Modules` — file paths for test derivation

File writes: use `Write` for new files, `Edit` for files that already exist on disk.

Check `CLAUDE.md` for a framework entry (format: `- framework: Name`) — skip detection if already recorded. Otherwise detect framework by checking project files in this order:

| File present | Framework | Test command |
|---|---|---|
| `Gemfile` with `rspec` | RSpec | `bundle exec rspec` |
| `Gemfile` with `minitest` | Minitest | `bundle exec rails test` |
| `package.json` devDeps has `jest` | jest | `npx jest` |
| `package.json` devDeps has `vitest` | vitest | `npx vitest run` |
| `package.json` devDeps has `mocha` | mocha | `npx mocha` |
| `package.json` devDeps has `jasmine` | jasmine | `npx jasmine` |
| `package.json` devDeps has `ava` | ava | `npx ava` |
| `pyproject.toml` or `pytest.ini` or `setup.cfg` | pytest | `python -m pytest` |
| `go.mod` | Go test | `go test ./...` |
| `Cargo.toml` | cargo test | `cargo test` |
| `pom.xml` | JUnit | `mvn test -q` |
| `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` | JUnit 5 | `./gradlew test` |
| `mix.exs` | ExUnit | `mix test` |
| `Package.swift` | XCTest | `swift test` |

If no match, ask the user what command to run tests with. Store the answer in `CLAUDE.md` as `- framework: <Name>` and use the command they provide as `TEST_CMD` for the rest of this session.

## Research

Check prior spec count: `find docs/specs/ -name "*.md" | wc -l`. If ≤1, skip to **Test**.

Extract key topic from spec title and key terms from Story section. Build pattern: join topic and all terms with `|`.

Run:
1. `find docs/specs/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -liE "PATTERN" {} + 2>/dev/null`
2. `grep -rlE "PATTERN" . --include="*.rb" --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" --include="*.go" --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=vendor --exclude-dir=.bundle --exclude-dir=.git 2>/dev/null`

For each matching spec: verify `status:` frontmatter exists (`grep -m1 "^status:" <file>`), then grep only `### Story` and `## Summary` sections. For each matching implementation file: grep PATTERN with 3 lines of context. Do not read full files. Use findings to inform tests and implementation decisions. If nothing found, proceed without.

## Test

1. Derive the test file path from the `### Modules` list in the Design section. Write tests from the acceptance criteria in the Story section.
2. Run `TEST_CMD`. All tests must fail — if any pass, the test is not specific enough or implementation already exists; fix the tests before continuing.

## Code

3. Write implementation to make them pass.
4. Run `TEST_CMD`. All tests must pass. If any fail, fix the implementation and re-run. Maximum 5 attempts — if still failing, stop and show the failing output, ask how to proceed.

## Review

Read every file created or modified. Check in two passes:

**Quality**:
- Conventions: code matches patterns and rules in CLAUDE.md
- Security: no injection, no exposed secrets, no unsafe input handling
- Boundaries: error handling at every external boundary (DB, HTTP, file I/O)
- Tests: specific, not trivially passing, cover meaningful paths
- Quality: no dead code, no obvious bugs, no unnecessary complexity

**Compliance**:
- ACs: every acceptance criterion in the Story is covered
- Intent: implementation matches what the Story describes, not just literal AC wording
- Edge cases: meaningful edge cases implied by the Story are handled
- Architecture: if `### Architecture` present, verify structural constraints respected
- UI: if `### UI` present, verify interface requirements met
- Integration: feature fits the system described in CLAUDE.md

If issues found: fix them, re-run `TEST_CMD`. Maximum 3 fix rounds. If issues remain after 3 rounds:

```
Review not satisfied after 3 rounds. Remaining issues:
<numbered list>
Proceed anyway? (y/n)
```

Only continue on explicit `y` or no issues.

## Wrap up

All spec edits happen before the move so the file stays at its original path until fully ready. If interrupted, re-read the spec to check which steps are already present before repeating them.

6. Append file references at the bottom of the spec as inline links — no heading, paths relative to project root. Include every file created or modified. Skip if already present.

```markdown
[filename](path/to/file) [test_filename](path/to/test_file) [other](path/to/other)
```

7. Append `## Summary` to the spec — two to four caveman sentences: what built, how works, key decisions. No filler. Skip if already present.
8. Append to `docs/MEMORY.md` (create if absent) any decision rationales — only the *why* behind non-obvious choices (not file paths, module names, framework entries, or pattern descriptions). Format: `- <topic>: <rationale>`. Skip if no non-obvious decisions.
9. Run `sed -i '' "s|^status: .*|status: implemented|" <spec-file-path>` to advance spec status.
10. Print:

```
Done
spec:  <spec path>
files: <all touched file paths, one per line, indented>
```

Ask user to open the spec in their editor.
